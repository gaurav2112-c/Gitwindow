Linux is an open-source UNIX-like operating system (OS). An operating system is a software that directly manages a systemâ€™s hardware and resources, like CPU, memory, and storage. OS acts as a GUI through which user can communicate with the computer. The OS sits between applications and hardware and makes the connections between all of your software and the physical resources that do the work.
